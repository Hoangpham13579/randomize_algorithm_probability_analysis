# Nemhauser Ullmann Algorithm to solve 0-1 Knapsack problem

Consider a list of items, each with a specified weight and profit, and a weight limit. The goal is to find the best combination of items that maximizes profit without exceeding the weight limit, with each item being included at most once. This problem is addressed using the Nemhauser and Ullmann algorithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- only standard Python library
